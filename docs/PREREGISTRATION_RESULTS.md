# Timestamp-audit report (pre-registered)

*Scored 2026-07-23 by `scripts/run_timestamp_audit.py` at commit `2e56815`
(committed before first contact with the backup; predictions committed at
`0af038b`, 2026-07-22 — the release that also carried them was later
withdrawn for unrelated scope reasons, see the pre-registration's §9). Quarantine copy frozen with a
SHA-256+MD5+size+epoch manifest before scoring. One run; this file is its
unedited output plus this provenance header.*

### Status of every derived analysis D0–D5

The pre-registration listed six derived analyses. For completeness, since a
report that scores only the one that passed would be selective reporting:

| # | claim | status |
|---|---|---|
| **D0** | the archival drift rate lands below 4 MHz/min | **not scored** — withdrawn before the data was opened (§8.2/§8.3): the corroborating wavemeter photographs proved to be outside the campaign window, and the in-campaign record is consistent with the 4 MHz/min envelope |
| **D1** | measure the drift rate from intra-block scatter ÷ block duration | **void** — the archive itself showed the intra-block scatter is jitter, not accumulated drift (§8.4), so it cannot be divided by a duration to give a rate |
| **D2** | drift model, $T$ vs $\sqrt{T}$ scaling of intra-block scatter | **void with D1**, for the same reason: jitter does not scale with block duration |
| **D3** | re-centring frequency consistent with rate × elapsed ÷ window | **not scored** — depends on D1's rate, which has no route |
| **D4** | 5-repeat block ≈ 80 s, from scatter ÷ drift rate | **VOID** — its premise (that the scatter is drift) was tested and falsified before the backup was opened (§8.4) |
| **D5** | median 5-repeat block span under ~70 s | **PASS** — median 34 s (post-hoc pass above) |

D1–D3 were declared in §7 as "weaker in standing than P1–P8", and all three
died on the same finding, which was itself made and recorded before opening
the backup. None of them was retired after seeing the timestamps.

### Post-hoc reading (content-matched pass; no pre-registered standing)

* **The recollected power ladder was direction-reversed.** The clock shows
  **descending** power — before-rulers → 225 → 175 → 125 → 75 → 25 mW →
  after-rulers — on **all four peaks** (a 5-rung reversal = 4 adjacent
  inversions per peak = the 16 scored). Peak order 4192 → 4207 → 4154 → 4121,
  17 July 23:41 → 18 July 05:00 JST; cooling 110 → 90 → 70 °C through 18 July
  daytime. Recollection and clock agree on everything *except the direction*,
  which was remembered reversed — the pre-registered §6 consequence applies:
  the clock wins, `DATA.md` §2 is rewritten, and the disagreement is reported
  rather than reconciled.
* **P5 lands emphatically**: median 8 s between repeats vs 383 s between
  blocks (ratio 48) — "back-to-back, seconds apart" confirmed, and the 1.8 ms
  position-scatter reading built on it stands.
* **D5 lands**: median 5-repeat block span 34 s, under the ~70 s bound derived
  from the no-drift-trend result at the cavity-locked drift rate.
* **T1's 24 failures resolve at content level into curation history**: 15
  naming variants (`4154_eom_070c*` without "nm"), 8 re-takes renamed into
  canonical slots (`075mw_1→075mw1`, `125mw6→125mw5`, …) — the DATA.md §3.4
  renumbering, now directly visible — and **one genuine absence**:
  `p_sweep/4192nm_225mw1.csv`'s analysed bytes are nowhere in this backup.
* P8's 4 flagged rows are a name-collision artifact of content-mode matching
  (a consistent-name recheck finds zero curated-before-raw violations);
  P7 is AMBIGUOUS because the pair names are naming-variant casualties.
* The backup carries a workspace file literally named
  `2025-07-17-Julia.code-workspace`, and every mtime has even seconds — the
  FAT 2 s signature of the stick it lived on.

## Addendum, 2026-07-23 (post-release consistency check)

**Edit ledger for the frozen pre-registration.** Its header forbids edits
after the backup is read, with corrections directed here. Post-run, exactly
one commit touched it (`d50366d`), and `git diff` confirms zero lines of the
prediction/gate/consequence tables (§1–§8) changed — the edit rewrote only §9,
the release-provenance note, after the `v1.0.0`–`v1.2.0` withdrawals. The
freeze on the scientific content held; this ledger is the audit of that claim.

**Corrected step-block listing.** The post-hoc section above was produced by a
scorer whose step-block filter used `"25.0"`-style power strings against a
manifest storing bare integers, so its five `p_sweep` entries silently matched
nothing and only the three `t_sweep` blocks printed. With the filter fixed
(same commit series), the full eight:

* step block p_sweep 4121 T=130 P=25: intra-block gaps [10, 16, 22, 12] s
* step block p_sweep 4192 T=130 P=125: intra-block gaps [30, 32, 10, 22] s
* step block p_sweep 4207 T=130 P=25: intra-block gaps [62, 20, 10, 20, 10] s
* step block p_sweep 4207 T=130 P=175: intra-block gaps [8, 128, 6, 6] s
* step block p_sweep 4207 T=130 P=225: intra-block gaps [14, 14, 8, 12] s
* step block t_sweep 4121 T=70 P=—: intra-block gaps [24, 6, 6, 6] s
* step block t_sweep 4192 T=70 P=—: intra-block gaps [10, 6, 6, 6] s
* step block t_sweep 4192 T=110 P=—: intra-block gaps [34, 18, 6, 6] s

One reading falls out (post-hoc, no standing): the block with the largest
position step — `4207 @175 mW`, whose axis offset jumps ~1140 ms between
repeats 2 and 3 — shows a **128 s pause at exactly that boundary**, against
6–14 s everywhere else in the block. The step and the pause coincide: the
scope was adjusted during a two-minute interruption, which is precisely the
"usually, not always" form of the no-touch tendency the experimenter reported.
