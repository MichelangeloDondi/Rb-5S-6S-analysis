# only turn red for a reason this machine could not have seen (an OS or
# dependency difference), never for one it could. The archive repository
# has no working CI of its own, so on the mirror this script is the only
# lint and the only slow battery that runs before the public one.

# Mirrors .github/workflows/tests.yml: the lint job, then the full test
# battery with the slow closure tests, on this environment's python.
